                        Beach Hack is an annual technical hackathon organised  by CODE, aimed at bringing together young minds to design innovative solutions for social problems and to help them actualise it. The first season “Beach Hack 2019” was conducted in the context of the college techfest "Techletics". The 24 hour hackathon was hosted at Munakkal Azhikode beach on 14th & 15th February 2019. The event witnessed great success and inspired us to continue this flagship project.
